# The Clinical Note Tagger
The Clinical Note Tagger was created by Oliver Bear Don't walk IV, Sandeep Ayyar, and Manuel Rivas for a class project in CS224N in the Winter of 2017. Please refer to [this paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2744196.pdf) for information on the Clinical Note Tagger was implemented.

# To Train

Execute the cells in the notebook [notetaggerBuild.ipynb](https://github.com/rivas-lab/clinicalNoteTagger/blob/master/noteTaggerBuild.ipynb) which will read in the data, train the model, and run validation code. Model weights are also saved for reusing later. Please use [predictionEvaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/rivas-lab/clinicalNoteTagger/blob/master/predictionEvaluation.ipynb) to evaluate trained predictions by the Clinical Note Tagger
